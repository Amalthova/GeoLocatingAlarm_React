#Geo Locating Alarm App

Basic Concept: 

Many mobile applications in Japan allow for alarms to be triggered when arriving at or near a location.  This is intended to allow individuals to sleep on long multi-hour train rides without the risk of missing their stop. (~2hrs)

It should be possible to extend this behaviour to also work as a way to disable alarms while away from their intended location.  IE: An alarm that is intended to inform you of when to leave the house, should not trigger if you have already left youtube.


This is first  version of the original concept which was written with Javascript and React. 

The original Javascript edition was made with the assistance of a tutorial video created by Jay Montojo
